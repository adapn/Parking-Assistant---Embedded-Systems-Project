## Software Design

### Key Algorithms

- **Distance Calculation**: The HC-SR04's echo pulse width is converted to distance using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Distance (cm)} = \frac{\text{Echo Time (Âµs)} \times 0.034}{2}
  \]
- **State Machine**:
  - **Idle**: System waits for user input.
  - **Active**: Measures distance and updates LEDs.
  - **Sleep**: Conserves power during inactivity.

### Interrupt Handling
- **Ultrasonic Echo**: Rising and falling edge detection via GPIO interrupts.
- **Button Press**: Mode toggling using edge detection.

### Power Optimization
- Sleep mode ensures minimal power consumption during idle states, achieving an idle power of 5mW.

## Data Flow and Communication

1. **Ultrasonic Measurement**:
   - Trigger signal sent by STM32.
   - Echo response captured by GPIO interrupts.
2. **Distance Feedback**:
   - Calculated in microcontroller.
   - LEDs indicate proximity status.
3. **Debugging and Logging**:
   - UART outputs distance measurements and system status.
